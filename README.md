## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

TechSpotlight is a cutting-edge blog platform designed for tech enthusiasts, crafted with a passion for innovation and user authentication at its core. With the proliferation of user authentication across virtually every website in today's digital landscape, the motivation behind TechSpotlight was to offer a seamless and secure authentication experience tailored specifically for the tech community. One of the reasons why I created this project was the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of developing a custom API. Whether it's dissecting the newest gadgets, exploring emerging technologies, or exchanging coding tips and tricks, TechSpotlight provides a dynamic and engaging space for tech enthusiasts to connect, comment and collaborate. I did gain extensive knowledge in integrating front-end and back-end components seamlessly. Additionally, I familiarized myself with innovative tools like Handlebars, enhancing my skill set and enabling me to develop dynamic and responsive web applications. I also implement some of my CSS knowledge so I could give the website a modern style.

## Installation :computer:

You are able to check this app by two ways:

 1. If you want to check the app, you can go to this URL: https://intense-wildwood-22129-d48c6b772546.herokuapp.com/ 
 2. If you want to try it yourself, you have to run the code down below.

## Usage :bar_chart:

You have to install the dependencies with the next code:
    
    npm i
    
After that you have to create a ".env" file following the example (file named .env.EXAMPLE)

Open a new terminal and log in to mySQL and run the next code, so we can create the database:

    source db/schema.sql

Now we have to seed data to the database:

    npm run seed
    
    
Now we start the server:

    npm run watch
